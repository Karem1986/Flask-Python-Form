# A Python flask form for users to fill in their contact details.
- The root URL (/) displays an HTML form for the user to fill out.
- When the form is submitted, the data is sent to the /submit URL using a POST request.
- The /submit URL processes the form data and returns a thank you message with the submitted information.
- The application runs on http://localhost:5000 with debugging enabled.
- This is a simple Flask application that demonstrates handling form submissions and displaying the submitted data.
- This application has been deployed with Docker. 
The docker image is available at:
